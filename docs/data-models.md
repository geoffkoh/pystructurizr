## Overview

Structurizr uses a layered architecture model based on the C4 model (Context, Container, Component, Code levels). The data models in pystructurizr represent this architecture:

```
Workspace (root)
├── People & Software Systems (static structure)
├── Relationships (connections between elements)
├── Deployment Infrastructure (runtime deployment)
├── Views (diagrams/visualizations)
└── Configuration (styling, terminology, themes)
```

---

## Static Structure Elements

The static structure represents the logical architecture of your system.

### Person

Represents a human actor or user role in the system.

```python
@dataclass
class Person:
    id: str                              # Unique identifier
    name: str                            # Display name
    description: str = ""                # Detailed description
    tags: list[str] = field(...)         # Comma-separated labels
    location: Location = UNSPECIFIED     # Internal/External/Unspecified
    url: str = ""                        # External documentation link
    properties: dict[str, str] = {}      # Custom key-value pairs
    perspectives: list[Perspective] = [] # Named viewpoints (security, performance, etc.)
    group: str = ""                      # Grouping identifier for organization
```

**Example:** End users, support staff, system administrators

### SoftwareSystem

Represents a software application or service that delivers value to one or more users.

```python
@dataclass
class SoftwareSystem:
    id: str                              # Unique identifier
    name: str                            # Display name
    description: str = ""                # Detailed description
    containers: list[Container] = []     # Logical containers (apps, databases)
    tags: list[str] = []                 # Labels
    location: Location = UNSPECIFIED     # Internal/External/Unspecified
    url: str = ""                        # External documentation link
    properties: dict[str, str] = {}      # Custom properties
    perspectives: list[Perspective] = [] # Named viewpoints
    group: str = ""                      # Grouping identifier
```

**Example:** Email system, web application, mobile app

### Container

A logical container (application, microservice, database, file system) within a software system.

```python
@dataclass
class Container:
    id: str                              # Unique identifier
    name: str                            # Display name
    description: str = ""                # Detailed description
    technology: str = ""                 # Technology stack (Node.js, PostgreSQL, etc.)
    components: list[Component] = []     # Components within this container
    tags: list[str] = []                 # Labels
    url: str = ""                        # External documentation link
    properties: dict[str, str] = {}      # Custom properties
    perspectives: list[Perspective] = [] # Named viewpoints
    group: str = ""                      # Grouping identifier
```

**Example:** Web API, database server, message queue, cache layer

### Component

```python
@dataclass
class Component:
    id: str                              # Unique identifier
    name: str                            # Display name
