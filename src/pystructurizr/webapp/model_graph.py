"""Full-model explorer: the whole static model as one React Flow graph.

Unlike a view graph, the explorer is not driven by a curated view. It shows
every person, custom element and software system in the workspace — with
containers and components nested inside boundary group nodes when the
requested abstraction level asks for them — plus every relationship,
attached at the level each endpoint is rendered at. Alongside the graph it
carries a flat search index over *all* static elements (regardless of the
rendered level), the raw declared relationships, and a map of which views
each element appears in, so the frontend can search the model and jump
from an element to the curated views that feature it.
